"use client" - To use client components in Next.js, you need to add the use client directive as the first line of your file 
               (before any imports). This will tell Next.js that this is a client component and it can use hooks. 
               Otherwise, Next.js will treat your component as a server component, which cannot use hooks.

//How to use useEffect

useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Hello!');
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Wines changed!');
}, [wines]);


//API code sample

let carsShowroomUrl = "http://localhost:3000/APIs/cars-showroom";

useEffect(() => {
    fetch(carsShowroomUrl)
        .then((response) => response)
        .then(e => e.json())
        .then(e => setCars(e as Car[]))
        .catch(error =>
            setError(error))
}, [carsShowroomUrl]);
